# Graph

A graph is a pair (V, E), where V is a set of nodes, called vertices, and £ is a collection of pairs of vertices, called **edges**.

• Vertices and edges are positions and store elements

## Terms related to Graph

### Directed edge:

- ordered pair of vertices (u, v)

- first vertex u is the origin

- second vertex v is the destination

- Example: one-way road traffic

### Undirected edge:

- unordered pair of vertices (u, v)

- Example: railway lines

## Directed graph:

- all the edges are directed

- Example: route network

## Undirected graph:

- all the edges are undirected

- Example: flight network
