# String

A char array is just that - an array of characters:

- If allocated on the stack (like in your example), it will always occupy eg. 256 bytes no matter how long the text it contains is
- If allocated on the heap (using malloc() or new char[]) you're responsible for releasing the memory afterwards and you will always have the overhead of a heap allocation.
- If you copy a text of more than 256 chars into the array, it might crash, produce ugly assertion messages or cause unexplainable (mis-)behavior somewhere else in your program.
- To determine the text's length, the array has to be scanned, character by character, for a \0 character.

A string is a class that contains a char array, but automatically manages it for you. Most string implementations have a built-in array of 16 characters (so short strings don't fragment the heap) and use the heap for longer strings.

# Minimum number of deletions to make pallindromicsubstring:
 
 There are two ways to solve this problem:

- A simple solution is to remove all subsequences one by one and check if the remaining string is palindrome or not. The time           complexity of this solution is exponential.

- An efficient approach uses the concept of finding the length of the longest palindromic subsequence of a given sequence.
