 # Array
 
An array is a list of elements of the same type, identified by a pair of square brackets [ ]. It is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. To use an array, you need to declare the array with 3 things: a **name**, a **type** and a **dimension (or size, or length)**. 

The syntax is: 

`type arrayName[arraylength]`

### Array in Memory

### Advantages

* Random access of elements using array index.

* Use of less line of code as it creates a single array of multiple elements.

* Easy access to all the elements.

### Disadvantages

To create an array, you need to known the length (or size) of the array in advance, and allocate accordingly. Once an array is created, its length is fixed and cannot be changed. At times, it is hard to ascertain the length of an array. Nonetheless, you need to estimate the length and allocate an upper bound. This is probably the major drawback of using an array.
