# Stack

A stack is an ordered list in which insertion and deletion are done at one end, called
top. The last element inserted is the first one to be deleted. Hence, it is called the Last in **First out
(LIFO) or First in Last out (FILO) list**.

When an element is
inserted in a stack, the concept is called **push**, and when an element is removed from the stack, the
concept is called **pop**. Trying to pop out an empty stack is called **underflow** and trying to push an
element in a full stack is called **overflow**.

## Main stack operations

- **Push (data):** Inserts data onto stack.
- **Pop():** Removes and returns the last inserted element from the stack.

## Auxiliary stack operations

- **Top():** Returns the last inserted element without removing it.
- **Size():** Returns the number of elements stored in the stack.
- **IsEmptyStack():** Indicates whether any elements are stored in the stack or not.
- **IsFullStack():** Indicates whether the stack is full or not.
