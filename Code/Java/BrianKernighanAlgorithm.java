	Brian Kernighan's algorithm :
		This algorithm is used for counting the number of set bits in a number in the most efficient way.
		
	Approach for the algorithm:
		1.Given a number n if we carefully observe the binary representation of n and n-1 we will find that
		 in n-1, all bits from the rightmost set bit of n will be inverted 
		 
		Let us see an example:
			consider n=28
			It's Binary representation is ->  000.....11100   (32 bit)
			now Binary representation of (28-1) will be ->  000...11011  (32 bit)
			
			we can clearly observe the above property with this
			
		2. Now we will take a bitwise and(&) of the n and n-1. this will turn off the rightmost set bit of n
		   continuation from previous example:
		   n=28		->	000...11100
		   n-1=27	->	000...11011
		   ------------------------
		   n&(n-1)	->	000...11000
		   ------------------------
		   
		   Here we can see that rightmost set bit of n is turned off (means it becomes 0)
		   
		3. we will keep doing this until n becomes 0
