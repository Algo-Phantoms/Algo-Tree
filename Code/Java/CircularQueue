/*
  Ciruclar Queue is a Data Structure which operates on the FIFO (First In First Out) Principle.
  The pointers to the first and last element are dynamic. 
                                
           First element -> O - O                   Last element -> O - O <- First element
                           /     \                                 /     \
           Last element -> O     O      may also be                O     O
                           \     /                                 \     /
                            O - O                                   O - O 
  
  
        O - O - O - O - O - O           may also be         O - O - O - O - O - O
        ^                   ^                               ^   ^
       first               last                           last first
  
  In a normal Queue, we can insert elements until queue becomes full. But once queue becomes full, 
  we can not insert the next element even if there is a space in front of queue. This is possible
  in Circular Queues and hence is a optimizes space consumption.
