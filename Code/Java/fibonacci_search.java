                        ALGORITHM

Step 1: Find a Fibonacci number that is greater than or equal to the size of
        the array in which we are searching for the key.
Step 2: Compare the key with the predecessor of the Fibonacci number obtained 
        in Step 1 and store it in index
Step 3: If the key and array element at index are equal then the key is present
        at position index + 1.        
Step 4: If the key is less than array element at index, then search the left 
        sub-tree to index.
Step 5: If the given key is greater than the array element at index, then search 
        the right sub-tree to index.  
Step 6: If the key is not found, repeat the steps from Step 1 to Step 5 as long as
        index = 0, that is, Fibonacci number >= array_size. After each iteration the
         size of array array_size is reduced.
