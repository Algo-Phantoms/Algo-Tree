/*

* longest common subsequence finds the longest subsequence that is present in both the strings.
* A subsequence is defined as the sequence that is same relative order but not neccesarily in a contiguous manner.
* Problem Statement : Given two strings s1 and s2 and we have to find the longest common subsequence from both the string
* Approach used : In this problem a dynamic programming solution will be used as the recursive algorithm have a overlapping
  subproblem which can be solved by using dynamic programming. We can use both tabulation and memoization but we will be using 
  tabulation in bottom up manner.
* First we will be considering a 2D array of size (n+1) * (m+1) where n and m are hthe size of first and second string respectively
  and we are taking an extra column and row to get the value of the substring of length 1 and 1 we need to have to value of 01, 00, 10
* Any position at i,j i.e dp[i][j] will denote the length of longest common subsequence of prefix string of s1[0...i-1] and prefix
  string of s2[0...j-1]

/*

* A sample test case for the LCS problem

TEST CASE:

    Input 1:
    2
    baz
    axyz
    aggtab
    gxtxayb

    Output 1:
    2
    4

* An example to demostrate the table view of the solution is
  s1 : BAZ
  s2 : AXYZ

        B  A  Z
     0  0  0  0
  A  0  0  1  1
  X  0  0  1  1
  Y  0  0  1  1
  Z  0  0  1  2

  So dp[n] i.e 2 is the required answer here as we can see that "AZ" is the longest common subsequence int the example problem .

* Time Complexity: O(nm)
* Space Complexity: O(nm)
