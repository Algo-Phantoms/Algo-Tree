Seperate an array of 0's and 1's

Step-1:Take 'T' (number of testcases) as input variable.

Step-2:Take 'n' (size of array) as input variable.

Step-3:Using a for loop store the array elements in an array a[i].

Step-4:Initialize counters c0 and c1 to zero.

Step-5: Using a for loop check whether array element is 0 or 1
and increment the counter respectively.

Step-6: Using a while loop print 0's for c0 times and 1's for c1 
times
