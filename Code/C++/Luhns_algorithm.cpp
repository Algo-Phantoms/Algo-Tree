*Luhn's Algorithm for validation of credit cards*

The Luhn algorithm is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers, IMEI numbers, Canadian Social Insurance Numbers. 
A credit card number consists of 16 decimal digits. The first (leftmost) digit corresponds to the type of the
card (4 for VISA cards, 5 for MASTERCARDs, 3 for Diners Club and American Express cards, and so on).
The next 6 digits correspond to the number of the bank that issues the card. The next 8 digits constitute the
account number of the card-holder. The last (rightmost) digit is a check digit that determines whether the
credit card number is valid or not. In order to determine the check digit, a checksum is computed as follows.
We first add the digits at the even positions (that is, the second, fourth, sixth, ... , sixteenth digits) of the card
number. Next, each digit in an odd position is doubled. If the doubled value exceeds 9, then the two digits
are added. Finally, these doubled digits (after adjustment of 2-digit values) are added to the checksum. The
check digit is so chosen that the checksum is a multiple of 10. Here is an example.
Card Number   5        9   8         7   6         5   4   0   2   4   6         8   1   3   5         5
Step 1        10       9   16        7   12        5   8   0   4   4   12        8   2   3   10        5
Step 2        1+0 = 1  9   1+6 = 7   7   1+2 = 3   5   8   0   4   4   1+2 = 3   8   2   3   1+0 = 1   5

Checksum = 1 + 9 + 7 + 7 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 8 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 5 = 70

Since the checksum is divisible by ten, 5987654024681355 is a valid credit card number. Write a program
that, upon input a 16-digit credit card number, determines whether the card number is valid. A 16-digit
integer cannot be accommodated in a long int variable, so read the input as a string (a character array).
