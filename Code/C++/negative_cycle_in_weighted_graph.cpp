/*
    Find if there is negative cycle present in the weighted graph using Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm
Approach:

* First take the input and we don't have to put it the matrix or edgelist form, we have to store them as per the given input. 

* Create the array which will store the weight till now iteration which will ne initialized by infinity(INT_MAX) except the source node which is 0 in our case will be initialized by 0.

* We have make two loops and make the first loop run for total vertex -1 times because the longest path in a connected path will be vertex-1 if we remove the cycles

* Second loop will run for the number of edges and in each iteration we will check if the current vertex is visited then it's weight + weight_to_vertex2 is less then weight 
  of the vertex edge the assign in the vertex2

* There is a count variable which take in acount if there is any change in weight of any node if there is no change then we simply break the loop

* If the count value is 0 means there is no negative cycle in graph.

* If the count value is not 0 then we will run a loop once again on the edge and check if there is any value change. 

* If count value is 0 means there is no negative cycle else there is a negative cycle.
