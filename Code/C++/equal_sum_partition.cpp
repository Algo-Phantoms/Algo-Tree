/**
    Problem Statement : 
        You are given a set of non-negative integers and the task is to divide the set in two half such that the sum of the elements of
        both the subsets are equal.

    Approach : 
        To consider all subsets of items, there can be two cases for every item:
            (1) the item is included in the optimal subset, 
            (2) not included in the optimal set. Therefore, the maximum value that can be obtained from n items is max of following two values.

        we will use the top down approach of Dynamic programming to solve this problem. At first we will calculate the sum of the 
        entire array and check if the value is odd or even. If the value is odd then it is sure that we will not be able to divide the set
        according to given problem and if the sum is even then We will create a 2D array (dp[][]) of size 
        (n+1)(sum/2+1). The value of dp[i][j] will be true if there exists a subset of elements from arr[0….i] with sum value = ‘j’.
