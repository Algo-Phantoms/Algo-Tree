# For each item you are given its weight and its value. You want to maximize the total value of all the 
# items you are going to put in the knapsack such that the total weight of items is less than knapsackâ€™s capacity. What is this maximum total value?

# To consider all subsets of items, there can be two cases for every item:
# 	(1) the item is included in the optimal subset, 
# 	(2) not included in the optimal set. Therefore, the maximum value that can be obtained from n items is max of following two values.

# Maximum value obtained by n-1 items and W weight (excluding nth item).
# Value of nth item plus maximum value obtained by n-1 items and W minus weight of the nth item (including nth item).
# If weight of nth item is greater than W, then the nth item cannot be included and case 1 is the only possibility.

# Approach :
# 	 we can see that the dp solution with states (i,j) will depend on state (i-1, j) or (i-1, j-wt[i-1]). 
# 	 In either case the solution for state (i,j) will lie in the i-1th row of the memoization table. 
# 	 So at every iteration of the index, we can copy the values of current row and use only this row for building the 
# 	 solution in next iteration and no other row will be used. Hence, at any iteration we will be using only a single 
# 	 row to build the solution for current row. Hence, we can reduce the space complexity to just O(W).
