GCD(GREATEST COMMON DIVISOR)

APPROACH:

     The solution is to use Euclidean algorithm which is the main algorithm used for the calculation of GCD of two numbers. 
     The idea is, GCD of two numbers doesnâ€™t change if smaller number is subtracted from a bigger number. This step is repeated 
     until second number becomes zero . When second number becomes 0 , the first number is the GCD of the two given numbers as 
     every number divides 0.

"""

#recursive function that returns GCD of 2 numbers
def gcd (a, b):  
    if (b == 0):  #every number divides 0 so return a
        return a   
    else:  
        return gcd (b, a % b)  

#input 1st number
a =int (input ("Enter the first number: "))  
#input 2nd number 
b =int (input ("Enter the second number: ")) 

#call to GCD(A,B)  
gcd_ans = gcd(a, b)
#prints the GCD of two numbers given by the user
print("GCD of two number is: ", gcd_ans)
