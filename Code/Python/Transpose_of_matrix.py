PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Given a matrix with m rows and n columns. Print its transpose. Transpose of a matrix is obtained by 
changing the rows to columns and columns to rows i.e., by changing mat[i][j] to mat[j][i].
'''


#A function to print the transpose of the given matrix
def Transpose(mat, m, n):
	#Creating a matrix with n rows and m columns
	trans = [[0 for y in range(m)] for x in range(n)]
	for x in range(n):
		for y in range(m):
			trans[x][y] = mat[y][x]
	#Printing the transposed matrix
	print(trans)


# Driver Code

# User inputs the the dimension of matrix 
m = int(input("Enter the no. of rows: "))
n = int(input("Enter the no. of columns: ")) 

# Creating a matrix with m rows and n columns
mat = [[0 for j in range(n)] for i in range(m)]
print("Enter elements of matrix:")
# User inputs matrix elemnents
for i in range(m):
	for j in range(n):
		num = int(input())
		mat[i][j] = num
		
# Printing the entered matrix
print("The entered matrix is:\n", mat)
# A function call to transpose the matrix
print("The transpose of the entered matrix is:") 
Transpose(mat, m, n)

TEST CASES:
1.
Input:
m = 4
n = 3
[[1, 2, 2], [2, 3, 3], [3, 4, 4], [4, 1, 1]]
Output:
[[1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 3, 4, 1], [2, 3, 4, 1]]

2.
Input:
m = 2
n = 1
[[8], [10]]
Output:
[[8, 10]]

TIME COMPLEXITY: O(m*n), because we're traversing each an every elemnt of the matrix of size mXn
SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(m*n), due to the transpose matrix created of size nXm 
where 'm' and 'n' denotes the dimension of the matrix as entered by the user.
