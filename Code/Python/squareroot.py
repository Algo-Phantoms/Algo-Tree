Problem statement: Given an integer,we have to find its square root.If the given number is not a perfect square then we have to find floor(squareroot(x)).
At first, take care of basecases that is when number is 0 or 1 .Now Create variables low=1 and upperbound high=n .Run a loop until low<=high.
Check if the square of middle (middle = (low+high)/2 ) is equal to n, If yes then return middle element.If the square of middle (middle = (low+high)/2) 
is less than or equal to n, If yes then search for a larger value in second half of search space,i.e low= middle+1, update result= middle.
Else search for a smaller value in first half of search space, i.e high = middle â€“ 1 . Print the value of result .
