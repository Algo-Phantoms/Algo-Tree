# Linked List

A linked list is a data structure used for storing collections of data. A linked list has the following
properties.

• Successive elements are connected by pointers

• The last element points to NULL

• Can grow or shrink in size during execution of a program

• Can be made just as long as required (until systems memory exhausts)

• Does not waste memory space (but takes some extra memory for pointers). It allocates memory as list grows.

###  Main Linked Lists Operations

• **Insert:** inserts an element into the list

• **Delete:** removes and returns the specified position element from the list

### Auxiliary Linked Lists Operations

• Delete List: removes all elements of the list (disposes the list)

• Count: returns the number of elements in the list

• Find nth node from the end of the list
